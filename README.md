# Virtual Store React / Redux App

e-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with live API server

## Phase 1 Requirements

Setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.  

**User stories:**

- As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products
- As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category
- As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence


## Phase 2 Requirements

Add the “Add to Cart” feature to application, which will allow users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.  

**User stories:**

- As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart so that
- As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart

## Phase 3 Requirements

Connect Virtual Store to a live API so that data is persistent and able to be separately managed.  

**User stories:**

1. As a user, I want to interact with live inventory so that I have confidence that the displayed products are in stock
2. As a user, I want to know to that when I add an item to my cart, that it is removed from inventory so that no other users can purchase it
